                        <p><img src="images/Snap1.gif"/><br/></p>

                        <p><strong>Store name:</strong> value entered here will be added to the &quot;Thank
                            you for shopping at&quot; phrase of all of the emails sent to customers.</p>

                        <p><strong>Store domain name (address):</strong> that needs to be typed in a
                            browser to access your store. Make sure there are no extra spaces in it and
                            add &quot;http://&quot; at the beginning of it. This value will also be added
                            to store's outgoing emails.</p>

                        <p><strong>General email address of your store:</strong> that will be used as
                            originating address in all outgoing emails. It is preferable to use email registered
                            in the same domain as your store to lessen chances of your notifications being
                            stopped by spam filters. </p>

                        <p><strong>Email address for order notifications:</strong> is your own email
                            where you want to receive them. Make sure to use the most reliable of your email
                            account, as this is your most important channel of communication with the clients.</p>

                        <p><strong>Protection from 3rd party scripts (captcha):</strong> is a requirement
                            to enter contents of a picture in the forms of the store before submitting them.
                            This prevents bot spamming of product discussions and other forms in your store.</p>

                        <p><strong>Date format:</strong> has to be chosen from two of the possible formats.
                            MM/DD/YYYY or DD.MM.YYYY. This setting will affect all dates entered and presented
                            in the store (news publication, order placement, customer registrations etc.).</p>

                        <p><strong>First weekday:</strong> affects sales reports presentations.</p>

                        <p><strong>Storefront pages default title:</strong> is assigned to the value
                            of main page's HTML title tag. It is one of the most important parameters for
                            search engine optimization. It should be concise, relevant to your store merchandise
                            and prospective customers. Never put here just the name of your store, especially
                            if it is not self descriptive.</p>

                        <p><strong>Homepage META Keywords:</strong> should contain terms that you want
                            to be found by in Google and other search engines separated by spaces. Even
                            though they do not help currently, because of a large history of abuse by search
                            engine spammers, they do not hurt either. If you place here something irrelevant
                            to your store's merchandise, it can tip off search engines to consider your
                            site as abusive. </p>

                        <p><strong>Homepage META Description:</strong> is a three to five sentences paragraph
                            describing your store. It will be added to the respective HTML tag of the page.
                            Text contained here is often used by search engines as a page brief presented
                            after a link to it in the results.</p>

                        <p><strong>Google Maps API key:</strong> is used to find your customers on the
                            map and calculate delivery routes in the store's back end interface. It is issued
                            for free by Google. Sign up form can be found here - <a target="_blank"
                                                                                    title="Google maps API sign-up"

                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Your warehouse or office address:</strong> in a proper form understood
                            by Google (e.g. 22, 5th avenue, New York). You can check your address beforehand
                            here - <a target="_blank" title="Google maps service" href="http://maps.google.com/">http://maps.google.com/</a>

                                Customers can rate products:</strong> will present the &quot;star&quot; rating
                            and ability to rate products on their detailed view pages. If <strong>Allow
                                customers to select products sorting criteria</strong> is turned on, visitors
                            can sort products within category by rating, price etc.<br/>
                            <strong>Weight unit:</strong> defines in what units you enter products weight
                            and is used by weight conversion calculations for some of the shipping modules.<br/>
                            <strong>Number of products per page (storefront):</strong> sets number of them
                            showed on one listing page. It affects category and search results view. If
                            number of products in the category exceeds this value, view will have additional
                            navigation to proceed to other pages.<br/>
                            <strong>Number of columns in the products presentation grid (storefront): </strong>affects
                            category and search result views as well. Make sure to check results after changing
                            these settings and use it in conjunction with picture sizes set below. Default
                            value is 10.<br/>
                            <strong>Stock level control:</strong> allows you to prevent customers from ordering
                            out of stock items and deducts number of them ordered from &quot;in stock&quot;
                            value set when product was added. When &quot;off&quot;, any item present in

                            message on availability. When previous parameter is turned off, it has no effect
                            on store's performance. <br/>
                            <strong>Allow customers to select products sorting criteria:</strong> if turned
                            on, category and search results views will have additional navigation options.
                            There will be an extra set of links around the list contents allowing to sort

                            to something more meaningful. Other settings for coupon discount are: active or not; type

                            applicable to them. You can set several steps with own discount rate each.</p>

                            discount, except that total of all orders placed, paid and processed is used to determine
                            discount rate.</p>

                        <p>
                            To set up shipping methods you need to access <strong>Settings –&gt; Shipping</strong>
                            section of the administrative back end. Here you can edit/delete already present methods or
                            add a new one.</p>

                        <p>Using click-and-drag present methods can be reordered, and will be presented in this manner
                            to customers. <strong><span class="ssylko"><u>Edit</u></span></strong> link allows you
                            tochange settings of the respective method, while clicking on a red cross beside it deletes
                            such option completely.</p>

                        <p>New payment method is created in two steps. First you need to decide which algorith will be
                            used for calculation. The following choices are available —</p>

                        <p><strong>No shipping rate calculation</strong>&nbsp;- is a «dummy» method for those cases that
                            do not require any payment from customer (e.g. in-store pick-up). This method does not add
                            any additional cost to the order.</p>

                        <p><strong>DHL, FedEx, InterShipper, UPS, USPS</strong>&nbsp;- methods allow you to use real
                            shipping quote calculations provided by the respective system. TO use these quotes you need
                            to have an account with the provider and enter registration and account info in the settings
                            of the method.</p>
                        <blockquote>Please, note!!! All of these providers work mostly with the continental US locations
                            and their service availability for other origination locations has to be checked
                            individually.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p> When one of these methods is chosen, store send a request to providers server with you
                            origination address, customer's location, orders total weight and chosen shipping options.
                            Cost received in return will be added to the order total. Some services allow to chose type
                            of delivery and packaging.</p>

                        <p>Following nethods are purely algorithmical and calculations are done based on their settings
                            inside the store.</p>

                        <p>List of methods - <strong>By countries/states module (fixed rates) </strong>and <strong>By
                                countries/states module (percent of order amount) </strong>allow you to set shipping
                            cost for the countries and their regions listed in the store's settings as a fixed amount in
                            aeach case or a percentage of the order total.</p>

                        <p>Following two, <strong>Ground shipping </strong>and <strong>Ground shipping (by
                                weight) </strong>allow you to set cost based on the customers address. It can be fixed
                            or based on the total weight of the order. Every country and its region can have a separate
                            cost calculation schedule assigned. Four methods described above will be offered to
                            customers for whose countries/regions they have been defined.</p>

                        <p><strong>Maximum of a fixed shipping rate and percent of order total </strong>is a combination
                            of thetwo options with calculating both of them and choosing maximum of the two to add to
                            the order's total.</p>

                        <p><strong>Fixed shipping rate + percent </strong>is a combination of the fixed amount for all
                            orders and percentage of the order total.</p></td>

                        <p>When new order is placed in your store, you as administrator receive a notification by email
                            or SMS. It contains order number and amount. To receive email order notifications you need
                            to specify address you want to receive them at in Settings-&gt;Settings-&gt;General-&gt;Email
                            address for order notifications parameter. After that place a test order and check if you
                            received a notification. If not, check you email account spam filters and adjust their
                            settings to let through emails from your store's domain name and address specified as
                            General email address of your store in the same section of the settings. Email notification
                            contains full details of the order such as customer's name, address, type of payment and

                            and CSV export function.

                        <p/>

                        <p>After initial installation you have several predefined order statuses. Order can be placed,
                            paid, shipped, delivered, canceled etc. Each processing stage can have its own status.

                        <p/>

                            during checkout, or comes into your store via specially created link with the affiliate's ID
                            in it. ID can be looked up in My account section of the main menu of the store front
                            available to registered customers.</p>

                        <p>For example affiliate partner is registered with the &quot;partner&quot; login and goes to
                            check his My account section of the storefront. Depending on whether Friendly URLs are
                            turned on he will see one of the two links: http://your-store.com/referral/5/ or
                            http://your-store.com/shop/index.php?refid=5. He can publish this link as it is on his own
                            website, mail it to his friends or post it in the blog. As a result, any purchase made by a
                            visitor that came using this link will be accounted towards commissions for the affiliate
                            partner. Links can be made not only to the home page, but to any product or category page as
                            well. For example, a link to some category in your store looks like
                            http://your-store.com/category/some/. If you add referral/5/ to it where 5 is the partner's
                            id it will have same result as in the above automatically generated link description. If
                            friendly URLs are off, then you category link will look like
                            http://your-store.com/shop/index.php?categoryID=556 and making it an affiliate referral link
                            requires extra ?refid=5 at the end of it. Same is true regarding individual product
                            pages.</p>

                        <p>If referred customer came through such link and registered, all of his future purchases will
                            also be considered as a source of commission for the affiliate. It will be so until store
                            administrator deletes this relationship by editing affiliates account info in Affiliate
                            program tab accessible in Customers-&gt;Customers-&gt;Affiliate's customer record. Same tab
                            can be accessed in Affiliate program section of the administration by clicking on the
                            affiliates login in a list generated upon commission calculation.</p>

                        <p>Commissions are calculated per administrator's request. In Customers-&gt;Affiliate program
                            section administrator needs to specify rate, set affiliates notification options. Beneath
                            them you need to specify date range and click View button to check database for
                            commissionable sales within it. After that you will see a list of affiliates with the
                            amounts they are owed. You can edit amount calculated and currency or completely delete
                            certain calculations. If necessary, commissions can be added manually by filling respective
                            fields below the list.</p>

                        <p>Once commissions are calculated, you need to pay them out by generating notification to
                            affiliates and specifying amounts within calculated limits. Resulting balance (commissions
                            less payments for the period) is shown as balance outstanding. It can be both positive
                            (store owes to an affiliate partner) and negative (when partner was overpaid).</p>

                        <p>One of the convenient ways to process payouts is to create one time use discount coupons for
                            you affiliates in the amount owed to them.</p></td>

                        <p>
                            Litle snippets of embeddable HTML code that can be built into any web page and present some
                            usefull information from another source are called widgets. WebAsyst Shop-Script has three
                            types of them. With their help you can place &quot;live&quot; information about your
                            products and store practically anywhere on the Internet. Widgets placed on other web pages
                            will work only if you have functional store they were created in..
                        </p>

                        <p><strong>&quot;Product info&quot; widget</strong> shows particular product information (name,
                            description, price, picture) and Add to cart button that allows its ordering.</p>

                        <p>If you already have product information on a widget target page, and there is no need to
                            duplicate it, use <strong>&quot;Add to cart&quot; widget</strong> instead. Place it near
                            product info and you site/blog/page visitors will be able to order product without visiting
                            your storefront.</p>

                        <p>In some cases, when you already have popular, well indexed site and plan to enhance it with a
                            shopping cart functionality, in addition to the above described widgets, use <strong>&quot;View
                                cart / Checkout&quot; widget.</strong> It will display visitors cart state. Independent
                            use of this widget has no meaning, as it does not provide any ordering capabilities, only
                            checkout of the already filled cart. </p>

                        <p>Widgets are created in administrative backend <strong>Tools –&gt; Widgets</strong> section.
                            All three types are avilable in one place. To create Add to cart and Product info widgets,
                            you need to look up product they will be linked to first. Enter part of the product name to
                            perform search and click Find a product button. Search results will be shown as a list.
                            Click on the product needed to see its widget HTML code. Copy code and paste it into the
                            target page HTML source code. Save it and check result in a browser.</p>

                        <p>Widgets can be adjusted for use along with the Affiliate program. This will require manual
                            editing of the link included in widget and adding affiliate's id into it. </p>
                        <blockquote>Please note!!! Current version of WebAsyst Shop-Script widgets may work incorrectly
                            with products that have selectable extra parameters. In some cases, widgets do not transfer
                            selected options correctly. The only solution would be to contact customer and confirm his
                            preferences.

                            will include your store's domain name, plus /auxpage_, plus link name entered. Spaces in
                            this field will be changed to dashes.</p>

                        <p>Page text field contains actual page text. It can be entered using built in HTML editor or
                            pasted as raw HTML code from another source. Built in editor has text formatting
